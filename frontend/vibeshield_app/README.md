# VibeShield AI - Frontend

Flutter hybrid app (Web + Mobile) for crypto portfolio monitoring.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

2. Run on web:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Production config (no localhost)

By default, the app points to the deployed backend origin configured in `lib/core/config.dart`.
Use `--dart-define=API_BASE_URL=...` to override per environment.

For production run with `--dart-define`:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome \
    --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://vibeguard-ai-production.up.railway.app \
    --dart-define=CHAIN_ID=97 \
    --dart-define=RPC_URL=https://bsc-testnet-rpc.publicnode.com \
    --dart-define=EXPLORER_TX_BASE_URL=https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/
```

### Environment / Build Defines

This app uses `--dart-define` for environment configuration:

- `API_BASE_URL` (optional): backend origin (no `/api`), e.g. `https://...railway.app`
- `WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` (required for mobile wallet connect): your WalletConnect Project ID

Example:

```bash
flutter run \
    --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://vibeguard-ai-production.up.railway.app \
    --dart-define=WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_ID
```

3. Run on mobile:
```bash
flutter run
```

4. Build for production:
```bash
# Web
flutter build web

# Android APK
flutter build apk --release

# iOS
flutter build ios --release
```

## Features

- Real-time Vibe Meter (sentiment visualization)
- Price and volume tracking
- AI-powered risk analysis
- Agent-first UX with pre-connect landing hero
- Responsive design (Web + Mobile)
- Agent setup flow with on-chain status (Activate → Approve → Manual Override)
- Demo WBNB helper (`Get demo WBNB`) to reduce setup friction during demos
- Explorer-ready tx history links

## API used by the app

- `POST /api/vibe/check`
- `POST /api/vibe/execute-swap` (requires `userAddress`)
- `GET /api/vibe/tx-history?userAddress=0x...&limit=50`
- `GET /api/vibe/agent-demo/config`
- `GET /api/vibe/agent-demo/status?userAddress=0x...`
- `POST /api/vibe/agent-demo/topup-wbnb`
- `POST /api/vibe/agent-demo/execute-protection`

## Agent Demo UX (current)

- **Step 1 — Activate agent:** spawn the agent with selected strategy.
- **Step 2 — Approve WBNB:** grant router allowance to protect funds.
- **Step 3 — Manual Override:** execute protection from backend guardian.
- UI shows live status (`agent active`, `approved`, `user WBNB`, `demo faucet WBNB`) to avoid blind clicks.

### UI status note

- Emergency Swap section is currently hidden in web by default to keep user focus on the Agent Demo flow.
- The API route still exists for legacy/manual testing.

### Why WBNB (not tBNB) for approve?

- `approve()` only works for ERC-20/BEP-20 tokens.
- tBNB is native gas token, so it cannot be approved.
- Router protection logic pulls **WBNB** via `transferFrom`, therefore allowance is required.
